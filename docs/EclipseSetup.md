# Eclipse Setup

To begin, add the cloned project to your Eclipse workspace. To do this, select ``File > Open Projects from File System...`` to bring up a new window. Then press ``Directory`` and select the ``Challenge-2`` folder of the cloned repo. Press ``Finish`` to add the project to your workspace. An example is shown below:

![Open Project Eclipse](./assets/images/OpenProjectEclipse.png)

With the project added, you will need to add the dependencies. To do this, right-click on the project in the package explorer, and select ``Build Path > Add External Archives``. This will bring up a file explorer window. Find the JAR file for the GitSubProcessClient (it should be called ``GitSubprocessClient-v0.0.9.jar``) and press ``Open``.

If everything worked, your project should look something like this:

![End Eclipse](./assets/images/EndEclipse.png)

With that all set up, you should be able to run the application!
